# PyBrowser
The Web Browser built in Python, for Python developers

The idea of the PyBrowser project is to improve the web browsing experience in a Python environment.
As an alternative to Selenium-based applications, PyBrowser would allow for an easier way to automate
tasks done in web browsers by providing tools for adding python scripts to its core. PyBrowser is supposed
to be highly customizable and easy to manipulate.

The present version of PyBrowser is merely a sketch of what is to come, but its already fully functional
as a regular web browser, just in case you want to play with it.
